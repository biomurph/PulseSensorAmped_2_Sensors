# PulseSensorAmped_2_Sensors
Working Arduino code that uses two pulse sensors at the same time.  
Modifiable for more than two sensors.   
With Arduino UNO, you could potentially have up to 6 Pulse Sensors !  

Works with the Processing Sketch found [here](https://github.com/biomurph/Pulse-Sensor-Amped-Processing-2-Sensors-Visualizer)
